## Description
Our application, **moodle**, is a mood causality tracker that allows a user to log their day-to-day emotional state and review it via an accessible visual interface: the *moodle*. The simplicity of the **moodle** interface belies the usefulness of this tool for individuals as a way of tracking their emotional history, or sharing it with care providers in an easy to understand way. It is inherently difficult to recall and capture specific emotional memories that are more than a few days old, but with **moodle** it only takes a minute a day to develop an easy to use *moodle* of your emotions.

  * Add emotions and journal entries quickly and easily via a simple interface

  * Review past *moodles*, and journal entries easily

  * Observe the change in your overall state of mind day by day via an evolving mooodle
